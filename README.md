## Bulk Browser

The Bulk Browser is a fuzzy finder for bulk commodities City Market, my favority local Coop grocery store. It can pattern match via UPC, Bin number, Name, and Brand. It is written in svelte mostly.

- [ ] tags for organic and conventional
- [ ] categories, for example coffee, granola etc.
- [ ] search history
